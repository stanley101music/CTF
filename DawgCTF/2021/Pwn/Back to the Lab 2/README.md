# Back to the Lab 2 (250)

### Description
> We installed this new HVAC system in the lab using NI instrumentation. Ooh, it's internet-connected. Can you get the flag off of it? It requires "company technician access" but we managed to convince the company to give us some old source code, maybe you can find a workaround?
