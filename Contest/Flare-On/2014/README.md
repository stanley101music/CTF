## C1
### File Information
* Portable Executable 32 .NET Assembly
  * dnSpy requires it to be runned under 64-bit
### Process Analysis
* First, It'll show up a window with a button named DECODE!<br>
  ![](img/C1%20-%20start.png)
* After clicking the DECODE! button it'll show up another picture with some unreadable string
  ![](img/C1%20-%20decrypt.png)
### Function Analysis
```csharp
private void btnDecode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.pbRoge.Image = Resources.bob_roge;
    byte[] dat_secret = Resources.dat_secret;
    string text = "";
    foreach (byte b in dat_secret)
    {
        text += (char)((b >> 4 | ((int)b << 4 & 240)) ^ 41);
    }
    text += "\0";
    string text2 = "";
    for (int j = 0; j < text.Length; j += 2)
    {
        text2 += text[j + 1];
        text2 += text[j];
    }
    string text3 = "";
    for (int k = 0; k < text2.Length; k++)
    {
        char c = text2[k];
        text3 += (char)((byte)text2[k] ^ 102);
    }
    this.lbl_title.Text = text3;
}
```
* This is the function that will be called when the user click the DECODE! button
* The unreadable string we've seen is ```text3```
* The flag might be hidden in ```text``` or ```text2```
* We can set breakpoint before it returns and take a look at the value of each variables<br>
  ![](img/C1%20-%20flag.png)
  * The flag is stored in ```text```
### Flag
```3rmahg3rd.b0b.d0ge@flare-on.com```

## C2
### File Analysis
* It gives a html file and an image
* The contents of html file is normal
* The image file hides some php code at the end<br>

## C3
### File Analysis
* Portable Executable 32
### Process Analysis
* After running the file, it'll show up this window and after clicking OK, the program will stop<br>
  ![](img/C3%20-%20start.png)
### Function Analysis
* main function (0x4024C0)<br>
  ![](img/C3%20-%20main.png)
  * This main function looks very wierd. It keeps moving values into stack and even calls on it
  * This is porbably a packed program
  * Use a debugger to figure out what it's actually doing
### Process Analysis
![](img/C3%20-%20eax.png)
* Now, we know it calls to ```0x19FD3F```, step in to follow the program

![](img/C3%20-%20popad.png)
* After a few step, there're lots of loops that modifying the bytes of the executable file itself
* Keep tracking and I find some interesting instructions, It pushes some large integer to the stack and call a function and since this is a 32-bit program, those value on the stack will be the parameters to this specific function
  * After the loop in this function is finished, we can see the flag in the memory, which is modified by this function<br>
