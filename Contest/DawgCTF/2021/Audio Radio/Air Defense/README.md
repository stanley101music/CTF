# Air Defense (250)

### Description
> At some point during this recording, a plane with tail number ~~N5928H~~ NE928H landed on a lake. The flag is the name of the lake it landed on. Example: If it landed on "Lake Ontario", the flag would be DawgCTF{Ontario}.
>
> EDIT: The tail number was a typo. The tail number you should be looking for is NE928H.
> 
> NOTE! The Cyberdawgs aviation office runs HackRFs, so this IQ file was saved in HackRF format (complex, with 8bit signed integer I and 8bit signed integer Q). That format's a bit of an oddball, so you may need to convert it to something else.
